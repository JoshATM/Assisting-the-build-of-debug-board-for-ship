I helped in the conversion from the old proprietary system to the up to date system.

To give some context, a ship all the way in the middle east (I think qatar) used a saia pcd1 to control their fire extinguishing system but there was a malfunction with something (I don't think it was major) but the captain didn't want to leave port until it was fixed. The issue was that saia didn't make that old system anymore so a new one had to be ordered, the next step was rerouting the addresses of the new system and changing them so they would fit the wiring of the old system with the old migs code. After all that, the final thing to do was to link up every input and output to a debugging board and find out what errors are occuring and why they are occuring. That's when I come in, I assisted in wiring, soldering and connecting this board up to the old pcd1 and the new one (as they should be displaying the same output if they recieve the same input).


This is what the old system looked like

(I don't have a picture of just the new one but it is the one next to the old one in the first image)


This is what the debugging controller looks like completed

This is what the debugging controller's board looks like before.

(I also don't have an image of it soldered with all the switches but all the 3 holes are where each switch would go)
